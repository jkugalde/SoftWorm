# Soft Worm

## Resume

My thesis project to get the Engineering degree, back in 2016-2017. You can read more about it at 
[Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332063464_An_earthworm-inspired_soft_robot_with_perceptive_artificial_skin) and watch a short video
in [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ2wraRIhEo).

It is basically a bio inspired pneumatic soft robot composed by 3 modules mostly made of silicone, which moves through cavities using a peristaltic
movement gait. The cool things about it is that it can crawl through irregular cavities, as the body is soft and it will adapt.
The movement algorithm requires that the robot anchors itself to the inner walls of the cavities, which is sensed
using a strain/pressure sensor also made of silicone with liquid metal micro channels. 

I am making this repository for storage, and also, to improve my coding skills with Arduino, which really sucked
when i did this. Maybe i will add improvements on the part files and electronics to build the robot.

## Files

Some Arduino classes and such, which i dont know if they really work because currently i dont have the robot. Parts and instructions in the future.
